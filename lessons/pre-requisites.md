# Welcome to the Structured Study Program!

## Pre-requisite work

Thank you for joining Hack Reactor's Structured Study Program, or SSP. Before we get started, we would like to learn how much of the required pre-requisite you've completed.

To do this, we ask you to:

 * Take a screenshot of your entire <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803" target="_blank">Udacity Intro to JavaScript</a> page
  * There are many tools that take screenshots. We recommend <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwii0redzsTVAhUoqlQKHTa9BgEQFggzMAI&url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/take-webpage-screenshots/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg?hl=en&usg=AFQjCNH3LJ6SzRuM9QYL2J7JP9Iqev3NRg" target="_blank">FireShot</a> because it will scroll down your page and stitch a long continuous image together for you.
  * Screenshot tools are also good for your future in the Immersive program and beyond. You will use them to helpi other people understand what you are seeing on your screen -- in support tickets, sharing on Slack channels, technical documentation, etc. Getting used to professional tools now is a theme of the Hack Reactor Experience.
 * Upload the image to an image hosting server
  * There are many free image hosting sites. We recommend <a href="http://imgur.com/upload" target="_blank">Imgur</a>.
  * <a href="../public/img/udacity-screenshot.img" target="_blank">Here's a sample screenshot</a> of the page we're talking about
 * Fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/m8jg6poVJhMv9DPg2" target="_blank">this survey</a>

Haven't finished 100% of the pre-requisite yet? It's alright, go ahead and fill out the survey anyway, then read below to learn what to do next.

### Next steps
Your next step will depend on what you answered on the survey. Read below to learn what to do next!

### If you have finished 100% of the pre-requisite
* Nice job!
* Click on the next lesson in the left side bar, "Using the Learn App" and keep going!

### If you have done less than 100% of the course and you will plan on finishing it
 * Awesome! We're glad you've decided to follow through.
 * Your goal should be to finish the Udacity course before the start of Week 2 Day 1 (W2D1)
 * If you finish before W2D1, great! Click on the next lesson in the left side bar, “Using the Learn App” and keep going!

### If you have done less than 100% of the pre-requisite and you don't plan on finishing it
 * We recommend that you finish the entire pre-requisite, but you are free to continue to the next lesson in the left side bar, "Using the Learn App".
 * Note - if you have a low problem completion velocity, we will probably recommend that you go back to the pre-requisite and finish it.

### If you are a repeat from last round of SSP and were unaware of the change in pre-requisite
 * Good to see you again! 
 * Codecademy changed their Intro to JavaScript course (less free content), but fortunately Udacity has an excellent program available. In fact, we think it's better than the Codecademy version and if you need to brush up on some basics we highly recommend you do <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803" target="_blank">the course</a> before repeating the toy problems.

## Struggling students
We use a number of metrics to measure student performance, but three main ones are:

 * Problem completion velocity (how many problems you finish per day or hour)
 * Attendance
 * Responsiveness to staff over Slack and email

If we notice you underperforming in completion velocity, but you are present and responsive, we will route you to one of our staff members who is equipped to support students who are showing early technical struggles.

If we notice you underperforming in attendance or responsiveness, it's likely that you picked bad timing to take this class. Here's what may happen:

 * We withdraw you from the program (full refund if you withdraw yourself during the first week)
 * Push you to the next SSP round starting on 08/28/2017
  * Fortunately, this round also targets the October Immersive start dates
  * 4-week program instead of a 7-week
  * Covers same content
  * You will be expected to complete some additional work before starting SSP again
