> GOAL OF THIS PAGE: Act as both orientation page and reference document for all the processes and rules that lecturers are expected to follow.

This page should orient you on how to be an effective lecturer at Hack Reactor. For context, you should start by reading [this article](http://bigbeacon.org/2014/02/rapid-iteration-teaching-and-the-evolution-of-education/) about Rapid-Iteration Education. The main takeaway of this article is that education should be data-driven, and lecturing in particular tends to be a dangerous blind spot for most educators.

[TODO - frame this whole document in terms of a (fake) transcript from an example lecture]


### Your Goal During Lecture

The biggest danger as a lecturer is to wind up speaking to a room of people who don't actually understand what you're saying, and it is also the primary killer of lecture quality. Students will not tell you they feel lost or left out, because it's embarrassing. The most common pitfall for most lecturers is that a growing majority of their listeners start to tune out, without the lecturer even realizing it.

Listeners start to tune out for a variety of reasons, the most common of which include:

* The listener feels behind, but does not want to admit it.
* The listener feels ahead, and isn't getting much from the material (and/or enjoys the feeling of being "above it").
* The content is perfectly targeted to the listener, but they miss something small the lecturer says, and don't feel it's appropriate to ask for clarification.
  * **This is by far the most common pattern**

As a lecturer, your primary goal will be to speak to the whole room and not let anyone fall off and stop listening, for any of these reasons.


### The Fundamentals of a good lecture

* **Your expertise is valuable**: It is important during lecture that you start from the assumption that the expertise you bring to the table is valuable. Little is gained by second-guessing yourself, and the cost is high. [TODO more detail here]
* **Predetermine Your Primary Conceptual Objective**: In order to provide a north star of your lecture, it is useful to have a clearly stated "goal mental model" at which you will work to arrive with your audience. This model should be a sentence or paragraph that an experienced practitioner would say "conveys the heart of the matter" as succinctly as possible. Listeners learn details fastest in the context of a central skeleton of truth, and having a PCO for your lecture will avoid meandering through avoidable details as you work toward that central skeleton.
* **You must cover each point you bring up in sufficient detail before moving on**: As long as you have not started to bore your audience, it is preferable to use up more time ironing that point out (and forcing yourself to schedule another lecture) than to move on without the satisfaction of all three demographics (explained below).
* **Always take the smallest conceptual step forward**: [TODO]
* **Empathy: the primary tool of effective lecturing**: Your main asset in avoiding dropoff is forming a **strong** mental model of the listeners. Achieving this primarily requires careful use of empathy, to imagine how different members of your audience might experience the lecture.
* **Watch yourself from a listener's POV**: When speaking, your experience as the speaker has little bearing on the perceived quality of the lecture. The entire learning experience takes place in the listener's mind, so you should be modeling and optimizing that experience at all times.
* **Your lecture plan is almost certainly wrong**: Since it is very hard to correctly guess what your audience will need to hear, very little of what you say should be motivated by your original "lecture plan." The actual lecture should be driven almost completely by your **primary conceptual objective** and by your discoveries from **measuring what the listeners have learned**.

### How to think about your audience

* **The Three Demographics**: You can think of the audience as breaking down into three main categories of listener.
    * You must keep track of how each of these 3 groups is doing at all times.
    * They include:
        * **median student**: The lecture is primarily pointed at this demographic.
        * **lower quartile student**: But you can never let these students fall off the wagon and check out.
        * **upper quartile student**: Your challenge will be to keep this student engaged (strategies below).
* **Primary goal - move the median students as far forward in understanding as possible**: The largest section of the audience is in the middle, so focus on moving them forward as your primary goal.
* **Primary Constraint - Your lower-quartile students CANNOT fall off track and punch out**: Reteaching anyone is a huge cost, and the lowest-quartile students will be needlessly jumping off the wagon all the time as they convince themselves that they are the only one confused about something. If you don't find a way of quickly picking them up and getting them back on track, you will pay a huge premium in repeating the material to many/all of them. The challenge here is to succeed at keeping them on board while not boring the rest of the room because you teleport back to old material. To avoid this boredom, use variety in your examples and wording.
* **Advanced goal - Keep the upper quartile engaged, despite the fact that it might feel like review**: Variety of language, example, metaphor, and rephrasing is your main tool here. For the upper quartile, this gives them new ways of thinking about something they already get, while teaching them language for talking about it. As a bonus, it gives the lower-quartile student a new opportunity to understand.




### Staying aware of what your audience needs

* **You have no idea which parts they understood**: Maintain an ongoing conviction that you have not conveyed an idea until your crowd checks demonstrate otherwise. In general, you should be constantly paranoid that you're losing them.
* **Taking Thumbs Checks**: You'll frequently need to know how the audience is doing [TODO]
* **Specific questions for thumbs checks**: Some particularly good questions to ask for thumbs checks include:
  + "How confident are you that you could explain [concept] to your neighbor? Thumbs up: I'm very confident; thumbs down: I'm not confident"
  + "Does [some new vocabulary term] have meaning to you? Thumbs up: yes, I know this term and could define it; thumbs down: I've never encountered this before."
  + [TODO: more questions]
* **Thumbs checks are not accurate**: Students will lie or mis-estimate their level of understanding. Once your thumbs check provides you with a distribution of self-reported comfort with the topic, you should offset it by guessing how accurately it represents reality. You then need to find out how good your guess was by testing someone with a question, to see if their thumb level was right. You can only choose one representative of one demographic for this, so search for the most useful target to measure.
* **Listeners won't challenge themselves**: Listeners will be tempted to treat the lecture experience as "basking in correctness," rather than engaging with the implications of what the lecturer saying. From their perspective, the experience of hearing correct statements will feel very similar to the feeling of learning to generate those statements themselves.
* **No Self Selection**: [TODO]
* **Pose questions to the audience at large**: To avoid allowing any listeners to "bask in correctness," you should always start by inspiring the right curiosity in your audience for the information you're about to provide. Before you provide the *answer* to any given problem, you should be careful to set up the problem, and convince listeners that the problem is very pertinent to their interests. Ask rhetorical questions that reveal to a listener what kind of problem they can expect to face, and make sure they're convinced of its pertinence. Make sure they can relate to the problem emotionally by simulating the sort of puzzlement they'll feel in the situation for which you're giving them tools. Do a "weak verification"*" of the fact that you've conveyed the importance and relevance of the issue by asking them directly whether the problem we're solving is clear.
    > Is it clear why this would be an issue, and what problem we're trying to solve here? [Pause and observe faces] Are there any questions about this goal? [Pause and observe listeners] Let's do a thumbs check - how confident are you that you could explain to a layperson why this problem arises. [Survey data from the thumbs check]
* **Verify the clarity of the problem by quizzing individuals**: Once you have weak evidence that the audience understands the problem being addressed, verify it by quizzing at least one student on the problem setup. You'll probably be surprised how long it takes to help listeners understand the very premise your lecture is based on. Middle-demographic students are a great target for this sort of quiz.
    > You had your thumb in the middle, which is great--I'd love to get your best guess at describing this problem we need to solve. [Most listeners provide a 20-80% correct explanation. Validate the good parts, and make clear which parts could be better explained]
* **Build up question-asking confidence early**: You want to support the student's fragile inclination to ask questions. Create a safe zone where their questions are not dumb. Once you have established their security in this (and provided your student is not in an emotionally vulnerable spot), you want to be as honest as possible in talking about the quality of their mental model of the topic. This goal is easiest if you can acknowledge what is correct in what they say, or how it might be reasonable to have come up with the idea. Finding those concessions will give you the latitude to frankly point out the ways in which their statement was false, inaccurate, or misguided.
* **Only answer questions in service of your conceptual goal**: You are not obligated to answer a given question directly, and should only do so in an effort to better support the needs of the whole room. Treat every question from the audience as a potentially misleading invitation to explore some unimportant detail.
* **A lecture is not like a conversation with one person**: When you receive a question, there is a high likelihood that the question does not represent the curiosity of the whole room. It will share some aspects and you should validate those aspects in your response, but don't get sucked into the trap of responding the same way you would to an individual.

###

* **Lecture Feedback is an essential part of the instructor-training process**: To receive feedback on your lecture, schedule another instructor (1-2) using the calendar system. You must schedule two time slots: the actual lecture, and another time slot for feedback. The recommended amount of time for feedback is equal to the length of the lecture.

Groundwork

- You need to have built an atmosphere of:
  - trust that they'll be respected
    - No one is dumb
  - Confidence in the pertinence of their questions
    - Everybody thinks their question is an outlier, and that they should wait to figure it out afterwards
  - Trust that they'll be told honestly when they're right or wrong
    - They need to be corrected in the ways that they're wrong
    - Caveat: struggling students need to be handled gingerly. In rare circumstances I will find ways of justifying their incorrect ideas a little more than I would for other students, but this is to be avoided as much as possible.
  - Engagement
    - Students should feel like they'll be held accountable for understanding at any moment
      - Call on people often to fill in blanks
        - keeps them thinking they need to be tuned in
        - Gives you diagnostics on how well your messages are landing


Reading the room

More than anything, you need clear feedback about how it's going. You can't rely on intuition, because it will so frequently be wrong. You need real visibility into what the listeners are experiencing.

- Read the room frequently
  - Comments and questions are almost never as useful as direct tutoring opportunities. They can easily waste the time of most people there.
    - Make sure you answer a question as if the audience as a whole has asked it.
    - Sometimes the question will not represent the audience as a whole. Table it for afterward or compassionately call out why it's not appropriate for that setting.
    - They also provide clear signals of what you've said that didn't actually land and how different the received message was from your intended message
  - Use thumb checks whenever you're not positive people would fully understand what you've said
    - Thumb checks should be indicative of how well they could do something specific, rather than just how good they feel or how smart they are
    - Always throw up a middle thumb yourself, to avoid biasing and shaming
  - Stop to solicit questions whenever it seems possible people might have fallen off
- don't speak directly to one student, except as much as they are representative of the room


Keeping them engaged

In order to keep people on board, you

- If you're cooking from scratch, make the students supply the ideas
  - When students have a relationship with the 
  - Don't solicit multiple ideas at once. Each new piece of input must be digested before a new one can be introduced.


The Balance

As a lecturer, you are trying to optimize two opposing resources.

You ride the balance point between the two, and try to find ways to get a better total of each without undermining the other too much.


Techniques for learning

- 1:1 tutoring helps you learn to build mental models of individuals
- Lecturing to small intimate groups helps you adapt these skills 
- Start by demonstrating your monologue version of the lecture before adding too much crowdsourced thinking through of the problem.
  - Student ideas can be hard to incorporate, so make sure you can tell the narrative of thinking things through in isolation, BEFORE adding their surprising input to the mix.
