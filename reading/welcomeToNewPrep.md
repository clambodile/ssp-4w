# Welcome to NewPrep

Hack Reactor has prepared this pre-admissions preparatory program to guide the study time of highly-motivated learners.

## Communication

### Email

We use MailChimp to send out important course-wide announcements. Some email platforms, such as Gmail, sort these emails out of your main inbox and into the "Promotions" tab. To make sure you receive all emails from us, move the email out of "Promotions" to your inbox. Make sure to select "Do this for future messages from..." so that future emails go directly to your inbox.

### Slack

Slack is the main platform you will use to communicate with the NewPrep commuinity. You should have received an invitation in your email inbox to join our team on [Slack](https://slack.com/).

Use that to create your Slack account and/or become a member of that team.

Please use your **real, full name** when signing up, so we can match up who you are.

When you arrive, say hello on the `#_orientation` channel and upload a profile picture of yourself into Slack. `**Paid Users**: You will be added to an individual private channel between yourself and our staff for dedicated support.` 

Any "getting started" type of questions, please ask them here.

## What you can expect

This program has 4 main modules:

1. Diagnostic
2. Mastering your basic tools
3. Writing code well
4. Live performance practice

We roughly estimate that working through the post-diagnostic materials will take you 60 hours of effort. Of course, it may also take you shorter or longer than that, but that's the guideline. 

This program is fully self-paced. We expect students to move through the material as fast as possible. Students with part-time availability should apply consistent focus of at least 10 hours a week. Talented students with full-time availability and aiming to be prepared for an immersive as soon as possible have completed the study program in as little as one week.

If you are aiming for either the January 30th or February 6th Immersive Program start dates, we suggest interviewing in late December or *very early* January. Use the information below to help plan minimum suggested study times. Don’t underestimate this! We encourage students to study and interview as early as possible.
* Part-time plan (~15hr/wk)
  * Typical time to complete study = 4 weeks
  * Should begin study program in early December
* Full-time plan (~40hr/wk)
  * Typical time to complete study = 1.5 weeks
  * Should begin study program by mid-December

## What we expect from you

This Study Program is intended for students who are serious about enrolling in our immersive, and committed to preparing for the Technical Interview.

We expect you to:

* Do your own work
* Make steady progress, preferably every day, and totaling no less than 10 hours a week
* Get into a rhythm / habit of doing this work
* Don’t just give the answer away to other students in Slack, even in a well-meaning way
* Don’t post your answers on the Internet - not even in your own github

## Modules

### Diagnostic

You will take part in a 2-hour timed diagnostic module comprising several programming problems.

We have designed this diagnostic with the introductory material in the Codecademy JavaScript course in mind. If you have absorbed the material in that course, then solving these problems should be straightforward for you.

Based on your performance on the diagnostic, we may jointly determine that more review would be helpful. In that case, you might be asked to pause before starting this course and re-examine the Codecademy material.

If you're ready to begin, then you will proceed into the following material.

### Mastering your basic tools
Fluent problem-solving rests on a foundation of small skills and small pieces of knowledge that are thoroughly and instinctively available to you while you are working.
If you have to think even a little bit to write a syntactically-correct for loop, or to remember how to add things to the object prototype, then you will have a hard time executing problems that require those things.

Programming involves keeping track of what you're doing at multiple levels of abstraction, visualizing the flow of execution of your program throughout time. 
That kind of thinking is mentally taxing, no matter how smart you are. Thus it's counter-productive to not-quite- remember JavaScript basics and struggle with fiddly syntactical details of raw code while you are trying to solve a problem at a higher level of abstraction. That's setting yourself up for 
cognitive overload and slowdowns.

In this module, you will be writing a LOT of small code snippets, to nail the basics. We'll be covering topics like this:

* Functions
* Conditionals
* While
* Variables
* Array
* Array iteration
* Objects
* Variables and references
* Higher order functions Map

### Writing code well
Any writer knows that it is more challenging to write an entire, coherent essay that connects with its intended audience than it is to write a single grammatically-correct sentence.

Writing code is similar. Knowing how to write syntactically-correct JavaScript fluently is one thing. But assembling bits of syntactically-correct JavaScript into a coherent, whole program is another thing yet.

With that in mind, in this module we will be encountering and applying useful ideas like these:

* You are a system designer.
* Your code tells a story: outlining and stubbing.
* Your mental model of memory.
* The value of testing.
* Be the interpreter.
* Writing clean code: Empathy for the code reader.
* Data modeling and the object-oriented paradigm.
                     
These ideas will help you write much better code!

### Live performance practice
In this module you will be putting it all together in live performance practice.

You will see video examples of other people's performance and you will record and assess your own performance. Just like hearing your own voice played back to you can reveal odd quirks in how you speak, watching yourself code will help you spot areas of improvement in how you come across to the interviewer. 

You'll develop a mental model of what interviewers are typically looking for as they run a technical interview. You'll practice problem-solving under time and audience pressure, which is its own set of skills, distinct from simply programming in itself.

Programming is already hard enough -- having to do it collaboratively with another person, thinking out loud and making sure you are on the same page with another programmer while you do it, makes the challenge even tougher.

Just like any live performance, you want to practice and rehearse. You will be encountering and applying ideas like these:

* Avoiding assumptions.
* Talking out loud at the right level of abstraction.
* Bringing your interviewer along for the ride.
* Using your interviewer as a coding pair partner.
* Choose a data structure and make a plan first, don't just dive in.
* Test-driven development: spend time to save time.
* Time management in an interview.
* How to get unstuck.

These practices will dramatically increase your chances of passing Hack Reactor's immersive program interview.
