## Your job: to pattern-match as doing the job

Your interviewer is pattern-matching for success "on the job" (or in this case, first "at the school", _then_ by extension "on the job").

There is some set of mental models that they have in their mind about what a successful candidate looks like.

Your job is to look enough like that candidate, so you need to gauge what those mental models are likely to be.

What does it take to be successful at Hack Reactor? In order to gauge that, let's first review how Hack Reactor works.

## Hack Reactor in a nutshell

Let's briefly review how the Hack Reactor experience works in its current state of evolution.

* Introduction to CS fundamentals such as abstract data structures. This is applicable to all types of development, not just web apps.
* Introduction to code pairing and team-based development.
* Introduction to many tools and techniques specific to developing web apps.
* Daily lectures and daily problems to solve.
* Constant code-pairing practice with many different pairing partners, requiring you to work well with many people, under deadline pressure.
* Multiple hands-on app-building projects, both building things from scratch as well as evolving an existing codebase.
* Deploying and maintaining your launched apps.
* Whiteboarding and documenting your technical designs.
* Presenting your work to a live audience.

As you can see, this is a pretty intense experience to have in just several weeks.

Naturally you have to be able to learn things quickly in order to make it through this program. But let's highlight a few success characteristics that may not be obvious from the outside.

## You are flexible and tenacious in the face of ambiguity

Hack Reactor throws a lot of new things at you.

Hack Reactor doesn't give you academic grades, as such. You get feedback, but you won't have the conventional-schooling model of getting an 'A' in one topic before moving on to the next. You won't know if you've mastered a topic before having to move on to the next. In fact, you won't totally **master** any topics, really. How can you, at this pace?

At any given moment, should you "go wide" or "go deep"? There's never enough time in the day to do all the things you want to do.

But of course, it doesn't solve anything to give up. It doesn't solve anything to complain that you weren't given everything you need.

The real world of professional development is far more open-ended and ambiguous than Hack Reactor. Hack Reactor consciously models that, to toughen you up and help you assemble the toolkit you need for success in the wider world.

Remember, it's called a "bootcamp". That doesn't conjure up images of taking tests so you can get straight A's on a report card, right?  It sounds more intense and real.

So it is.

A successful candidate looks like they can handle this, before admissions.

### What to do before and during the interview?

In the interview, **don't give up**.

Don't even implicitly hint at giving up by being down on yourself. **Don't say little self-deprecating things**.

Keep it calm and **professional and results-oriented**. You don't have to be delusionally self-confident, but you do have to show that you can handle yourself under pressure.

How can you get to this magical state? Before the interview, practice **making a plan** so you're less likely to get flustered and freeze up as you go. Practice **getting unstuck** so you don't freeze up (which can look like giving up).

## You can get things working

It isn't enough to just talk about how things work. You have to actually make them work.

Making anything non-trivial work in software development usually involves rapidly gathering and applying a lot of info about a lot of different things.

You are comfortable "going wide".

### What to do before and during the interview?

In the interview, demonstrate that you know how to build small programs, and furthermore can do so under pressure.

Before the interview, **just practice -- a lot!** Build many small programs that work, first of all. (That's what you practiced in the first two modules of this course) Then build them under deadline and live-audience pressure. (That's what you're practicing in the third module of this course.)

## You care about how and why things really work

Conversely to the above point, it isn't enough to just make things work. You have to know (within reason) why they work.

It isn't enough to just glue things together so the system somehow works, (and appear  pleasantly surprised at that outcome!) A strong engineer knows _why_ it works. A strong engineer knows these deeper things because they _care_. They're curious, they believe knowledge is power, they see knowing things as part of being professional.

You are comfortable "going deep".

### What to do before and during the interview?

In the interview, talk about your choice of strategy and your implementation details in a manner that suggests you understand how things work. **Use the specific technical names that describe what you are doing.**

Before the Readiness Assessment, look over this [skills check list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NFwCaRz2itq7Gix1Bnz-_VwzZgC7ZCeBEmPh0sszO54/edit). Do you know what all the bulleted terms mean? **Can you use many of these terms when talking about your own code?** If not, look them up and practice using them!


## You care about the details, you are professional

It isn't enough to just barely get things working but your code is a mess.

Would you feel confident about hiring such a coder?

### What to do before and during the interview?

It's easy to know what to do here during the interview: take a little extra effort to **keep your code cleanly organized**, like we've been practicing in this course. It looks good and helps you avoid little time-wasting mistakes.

## You can work well with others

This one is kind of a no-brainer. There are just too many tasks and areas of responsibility in a real production system for a "lone wolf" approach to engineering.
