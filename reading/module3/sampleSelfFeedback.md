## Overview 

Everyone struggles at first, but there is no way to get better at problem-solving in a live performance than to:

* rehearse
* analyze your performance
* rehearse again

Look over the results that other learners have obtained from tackling the practice problems. Use other people's experience as cautionary tales. Find things to watch out for in your own performance.

## Self-feedback examples

### Person A

#### Flipper

- Less 'umms'!
- I could have done a better job outlining the approach. For example, I could have talked about the helper functions I was planning to include instead of just writing them. 
- I chose an overly-complicated implementation approach to handle varying length. I later realized there was a much simpler way to do it.
- I should have added a couple more tests.
- Numerous minor syntax mistakes.


#### Big flipper

* I seem to have a tough time fully planning the approach before coding.
    * I'm ok at coding in manageable bits so I can pick up errors along the way.
    * However, if I try to psuedo code the problem completely ahead of time I often miss items that cause me to slightly modify the strategy in real time while coding.
    * I know this is a balance, but I feel more comfortable uncovering problems as I code and only spending the first few minutes planning. 
* The code is fairly simple (for loops instead of more advanced functions), but I'm finding I don't have time to refactor in 20 minutes. 
* I felt like I recovered nicely from a syntax error in a conditional statement, but I remain concerned that I have the benefit of live testint, which I have not had the option to use in previous HR interviews.

### Person B

#### Flipper

- I did not get a working solution.
- My approach and implementation were still too detailed and included JS jargon. I should take a step back and aim to be more high-level.
- I should definitely practice higher-order functions more. I'm still using for-loops as a crutch.
- There were some long pauses during implementation and de-bugging. I can use this time to engage with the interviewer and have a more collaborative mindset.
- I could also improve my variable naming.

#### Big flipper

What I liked:

- I got a working solution.
- I did not just dive into coding.
- I think my approach early on was a bit more high level.

Areas to improve:

- Naming of variables.
- I need to think/explain/type/implement faster.
- Still need practice higher-order functions.

#### Outliers 

What I liked:

- I began testing components throughout the implementation. 
- I didn't just dive into coding.

What I didn't like:

- There are still some side effects.
- Even though I was speaking to a computer screen, I could have done a better job engaging and collaborating with the interviewer.
- There was clearly JS jargon in my implementation strategy. This area should be more high-level. I need to remember that I may be speaking to a python programmer.
- The implementation of the ternary operator could have been more smooth. Post-recording, I found that I just needed to put `return` in front.

#### Transpose

What I liked:

- My interview style is starting to feel more natural
- I'm still practicing TDD
- I'm not diving into coding.

What I didn't like:

- I did not get a working solution.
- Under pressure, I'm still using for-loops instead of higher-order functions.

#### Rotate this

What I liked:

- I got a working solution using higher-order functions
- I did not just dive into coding
- I tested components along the way

What I can improve:

- I had some time at the end, I could have revised some of the variable names

### Person C

#### Flipper

- forgot to write the last function that uses all the previous ones.. 
- too much hesitation
- still not sure how to use reduce and splice functions in this case.

#### Big flipper 

* Still feel i am rambling sometimes.
* Because of time pressure i was forced to use for loops intead of other functional methods.

#### Transpose

- Still feeling the need to use for loops under time pressure.
- Could have separated more into helper functions.

--- 

### Person D

#### Flipper

- Still jumping into coding without having a COMPLETELY fleshed out plan.
- Spending too much time during troubleshooting... I can detect the problem, but fixing it is taking too long
- Positive: I did utilize 'Be The Interpreter' and it helped me to quickly catch the logic error

#### Big flipper

Need to breathe more and really drive home the logical/step-by-step thinking and implementation.

#### Outliers

- Could break down my functions even further, making reduce/map/etc its own function, will be easier for debugging
- Need to work on my voice... Starting to feel that I'm borderline mumbling. Need to learn how to walk and chew gum at the same time

#### Transpose

- Still a very 'clunky' solution. Doesn't look clean at all
- Perhaps I'm taking too much time explaining things, when I should just be plowing along.
- Need to come up with simpler logic, not satisfied with my working implementation

#### Find the pair

- Definitely by far the best performance I've done to date
- Still feeling like I'm explaining too many minor details that might count against me. But the dead silence is nerve racking

### Person E

#### Flipper

* I spent 5 minutes implementing the test. That's something that I should just practice to implement in sub 1 minute. 
* Also should have made a smaller string to test at first.
* I feel like the skeleton itself was a little sparse and I could go into more detail
* I should probably have tested each function's implementation as I went along rather than at the end.
* Need to talk more, but part of that is without someone in the room/ on the other end.
* I made an early assumption about string length, which tripped me up initially

#### Outliers

* when I panicked a bit over it not working the right way out of the gate, I stopped talking completely - i know i need to get better about explaining my thought process while fixing the problem.
* also i need to be better about explaining 'what' is happening instead of narrating my coding implementation
