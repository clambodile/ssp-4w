## Fast typing "ups your game"

This may sound strange at first, but it's very helpful for both coding and interviewing to be able to type quickly.

The faster you can type (within reason)...

* The faster you can write out the "skeleton" of your solution.
* The faster you can try out snippets of code to figure out how JavaScript behaves in some area.
* The faster you can implement the bodies of your stubbed-out functions.
* The faster you can assemble test data.
* The faster you can write your tests.
* The faster you can test your components and build upon them.
* The faster you can get to a working solution!

Although the length of the interview slot is fixed -- the same for everyone -- you buy yourself more time by typing faster.

## How your typing is perceived

Your typing speed is one of those things that subconsciously impacts how your interviewer perceives you.

If you're a fast, accurate typist...

* You look like you think faster (although this is silly, yes, slow typists can think very fast).
* You look professional.
* You look like you get things done.
* The interviewer is less likely to become bored watching you slowly peck away assembling your thoughts.

Naturally, this subtle perception isn't all that fair, but... as they say, life isn't fair. 

## A relevant article

Read this article from Jeff Atwood: [We Are Typists First, Programmers Second](https://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/).

Note: Jeff is the guy behind Stack Overflow, the online resource for programming Q&A that you've probably encountered by now.

Now, this is arguable (like anything). If you happen to scroll down to the comments, you will see many people doing just that, arguing.

But Jeff's response here is pretty practical and accurate, in our industry experience (click to enlarge if need be):

## But I don't have time to practice this on top of everything else I have to do.

Right, you probably won't have time to change your base typing speed much before your interview.

However you can be **conscious** that your typing speed does matter. Push yourself during practice to keep moving briskly.

Aim for speed and precision in your typing, just like in your thinking and general execution. Don't inadvertently sell yourself a little short by being a little lazy about the mechanics of your writing.
