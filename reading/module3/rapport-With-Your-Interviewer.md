## Bringing your interviewer along for the ride

In the live interview, you will have another engineer beside you. Your interviewer is not just *observing* you but actually *interacting* with you.

In doing so, that person is looking in a friendly but rigorous way for you to [pattern-match as a strong fellow engineer](http://hackreactor.teachable.com/courses/hack-reactor-prep/lectures/1732071).

You want to give your interviewer as much positive material as possible for their post-interview writeup. One of the best ways to do that is to "bring your interviewer along for the ride". In other words, as you are interviewing, you aren't just solving the coding problem in front of you, you are trying to do so in a way that shows that you can solve lots of _other_ coding problems in a collaborative, productive way with your teammates. 

Hack Reactor isn't about being a monster coder by yourself in a cave in the woods somewhere. It's about preparing you to code well in teams, because that's how the real work world operates.

So demonstrate early on that you have the right personality, attitude, and basic collaborative problem-solving skills to operate well inside a team.

## In your interview, you are pair-programming (kinda)

One way of thinking about your interview is as a pair-programming exercise. Your interviewer is looking for you to be a good pairing partner. Although this isn't full-on pairing, i.e., where you trade off who is "driving" (coding) vs "navigating" (advising / spot-checking), nonetheless it's very useful to think of it as pairing.

Treat your interviewer as a kind of coding pair partner, not as a judge, jury, and executioner.

That means it's not only ok, it's very good to ask questions and invite input from the interviewer.  They should not be silent for 45 minutes mutely watching your performance. That's boring and sub-optimal for both sides.

## In your interview, you are a technical communicator

Your interviewer is looking for you to be a clear technical communicator.

Being able to concisely & quickly convey and discuss your technical design and implementation ideas is a key skill for collaborate software development.

Thus, during your interview --

* if you are mute the whole time, or 
* just mutter indistinctly to yourself, or 
* talk garrulously in circles about nothing much of import, or
* if you try to explain what you are planning to do, but your interlocutor has no clear idea what you are talking about

... then that's no good.

Make it easy to coordinate. You're trying to convince someone else that your ideas are sound. As such, it's your job to be clear.


## Talking out loud at the right level of abstraction

Most people when they hear that they need to talk out loud while they are coding will do something like this:

> Ok so now I'm writing a for loop to loop through the array. So let's set up the index variable, and increment it until we get to the end of the array. With each loop, we will grab the next element and process it...


To be blunt, that kind of verbiage is almost entirely useless. It is marginally better than saying nothing at all, but only just barely.

Your coding partner AKA interviewer knows a lot about how JavaScript works and how programming in general works.  Telling her/him about that stuff in minute detail doesn't serve any purpose.  I mean, we can _see_ what you're typing right? :)

### Have empathy for your partner

Imagine you were on the "other side of the table" so to speak. Think about what you would want to hear, how you might want to participate.

You don't really want to hear someone mechanically describing what they are typing. You want to hear about things at the level of the _decisions_ that are being made. That way you get a chance to influence those decisions, perhaps. 

If there's a blockage of some kind, you also want to hear about the troubleshooting thought process. That way you get a chance to help!

### Share your higher-level thought process, not mechanical stuff

'Nuff said.
 
Now go make some practice videos and get ready for the real thing! :)
