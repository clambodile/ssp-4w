## Welcome to the Structured Study Program!

We're excited to have you as part of the Hack Reactor family! Here's some important information about the course that you should read carefully.

### <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTgaG4ISeb_hJXP0iJ9UdWeFbASfpxtfpMhlW9y1pFpr7Z3kpbDxYpEeN1ERoZ4wiT-br_dDhZ10_T2/pubhtml?gid=745761445&single=true">Program Schedule/Syllabus</a>

### Content Pacing

Please keep in mind that the pacing laid out in the Program Schedule/Syllabus linked above is an outline of approximately what sections you need to have done by when in order to have a good chance of being prepared for the Readiness Assessment. Some important notes:

* If you start to fall behind the recommended pacing, don't stress out! Everyone learns at different rates and the worst thing you could do is to quit. Continue coming to class and work through the content at whatever pace you can. In a worst case scenario, you can re-enroll in a future round of SSP. Please contact your Class Coach
* If you are accelerating beyond the recommended pacing, congrats! There is no speed limit. Keep working at your pace and let us know when you run out of content. We have plenty of resources to point you towards to keep your learning going.
* We wanted to remind you that SSP is an experimental program that's undergoing changes. The schedule you see below may shift depending on a number of different of factors. We ask you to expect and embrace the changes.

### Pre-requisite work

It's time for your first exercise doing something you will do almost daily as a software developer -- using screenshots. Let's practice a screenshot workflow on the required pre-requisite work for SSP.

 * If you have finished 100% of the Udacity pre-requisite: take a screenshot of your entire <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803" target="_blank">Udacity Intro to JavaScript</a> page.
  * There are many tools that take screenshots. We recommend <a href="https://evernote.com/products/skitch" target="_blank">Skitch</a> because it has convenient annotation features, as well as saving a history of your screenshots.
  * Screenshot tools are also good for your future in the Immersive program and beyond. You will use them to help other people understand what you are seeing on your screen -- in support tickets, sharing on Slack channels, technical documentation, etc. Getting used to professional tools now is a theme of the Hack Reactor Experience.
  * It's unlikely that you can fit your entire page in a single screenshot unless you zoom out a bit. You can zoom out in Chrome using `âŒ˜ and -` on Mac or `Ctrl and -` on PC and Linux.
  * Do the following things to your screenshot.
     * Include the url bar in your screenshot
     * Annotate your first and last name towards the top of the page
     * Pixelate the blue "Resume Learning" button in the top right corner
     * Draw a box around your percentage completion
     * <a href="http://imgur.com/a/wMako" target="_blank">Here's a sample screenshot</a> of what the page should finally look like
 * Upload the image to an image hosting server
  * There are many free image hosting sites. We recommend <a href="http://imgur.com/upload" target="_blank">Imgur</a>.
 * Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdr2CQhWiwpc2SYIHxfAZcelHnKjBkUFS9xmX2CGpq_BJWEiA/viewform?usp=sf_link">this survey</a>

Haven't finished 100% of the pre-requisite yet? It's alright, go ahead and fill out the survey anyway, then read below to learn what to do next.

##### If you have finished 100% of the pre-requisite
* Nice job! The survey will ask you for the link to your screenshot.
* Keep scrolling down and read the next section, "How will you be assessed?"

##### If you have done less than 100% of the course and you will plan on finishing it
* Awesome! We're glad you've decided to follow through. You will not be asked for your screenshot link.
* Your goal should be to finish the Udacity course before the start of Week 1 Day 3 (W1D3). There will be a Self Assessment on that day that covers the content of the pre-requisite.
* If you finish before W1D3, great! Re-submit <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdr2CQhWiwpc2SYIHxfAZcelHnKjBkUFS9xmX2CGpq_BJWEiA/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">the survey</a> then read on to the next section, "How will you be assessed?"

##### If you have done less than 100% of the pre-requisite and you don't plan on finishing it
* We recommend that you finish the entire pre-requisite, but you are free to continue reading the next section.
* Note - if you have a low problem completion velocity, we will probably recommend that you go back to the pre-requisite and finish it.

##### If you are a repeat from last round of SSP and were unaware of the change in pre-requisite
* Good to see you again!
* Codecademy changed their Intro to JavaScript course (less free content), but fortunately Udacity has an excellent program available. In fact, we think it's better than the Codecademy version and if you need to brush up on some basics we highly recommend you do <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803" target="_blank">the course</a> before repeating the toy problems.

### How will you be assessed?

It is extremely important that as a student learning software engineering that you are self-aware of your struggles. First and foremost, we rely on you escalating concerns to your Class Counselor when you think you're not doing well. Aside from that, we use a number of things measure student performance. The main ones are:

#### Ongoing metrics

Including, but not limited to:

 * Problem completion velocity (how many problems you finish per day or hour)
 * Self Assessment scores
 * Not skipping problems
 * Attendance
 * Responsiveness to staff over Slack and email
 * Attitude towards friction and feedback
 * Reading everything thoroughly

If we notice you underperforming in completion velocity, but you are present and responsive, we will route you to one of our staff members who is equipped to support students who are showing early technical struggles.

If we notice you underperforming in attendance or responsiveness, it's likely that you picked bad timing to take this class. Here's what may happen:

 * We withdraw you from the program (full refund if you withdraw yourself during the first week)
 * Push you to the next SSP round
  * Covers same content
  * You will be expected to complete some additional work before starting SSP again

#### Self Assessments

There will be a handful of timed self assessments through the program. These are meant for you to use as a mirror to understand how well you're digesting the material. Each self assessment is cumulative and could cover any topic leading up to it. If you feel that you are struggling on the self assessments, it's a good sign that you should have a chat with your Class Counselor.

#### Final Readiness Assessment

This is the final gating assessment before your admission the Hack Reactor Immersive Program. We will provide more details on this when we get closer to the week we are taking them.

Note: Students interested in San Francisco will likely have a 2-step Readiness Assessment process.

### Classroom behavior

SSP is a collaborative environment where you will quickly make friends and contribute to a positive community. We exist on the border of school and industry so students can sometimes behave casually with one another or staff.

This is a reminder that you must conduct yourself professionally at all times. Any behavior that would not be ok at a job is not ok here.

If you find yourself in a situation where you feel a line has been crossed, please talk to your Class Counselor immediately. If we determine that you have crossed a line, we may remove you from SSP and prohibit you from participating in any Hack Reactor program in the future.
