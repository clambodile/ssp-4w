## What's a "tuple"? What's a "triple"? What's the difference between a tuple and a set?

## What is the average and worst-case time complexity of access, search, and insertion for these common data structures:
array, queue, stack, singly-linked list, hash table, BST.  For each combination of data structure and operation, briefly explain why you gave the answer you did.

## Give a brief analogy explaining how computer memory works to a beginning programmer.

## Using official terminology, explain how Promises work in JS, including chaining/sequencing promises.
-- Some terms to use: pending, fulfilled, rejected, resolve, reject, then, catch, all.

## From memory, write the one-liner that determines if a given string is a palindrome.

## From memory, write the one-liner that generates a random number between two given integers. Two lines, rather: Offer variants where the last number is excluded versus included in the range of possible output.

## From memory, write the short function to shuffle a deck of cards with complete randomness.
Hint: You should know the Fisher-Yates shuffle. You shouldn't be deriving random shuffles on the fly, as it will slow you down when doing card-game type problems.

## From memory, write the shortest code snippet in JS for cloning an array. Hint: it's only about 8 characters long including punctuation.

## From memory, write a code snippet that binary-searches an array.

## From memory, write code snippets for BFS and DFS of a BST.

## From memory, write 3 code snippets that do: pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal of a BST.

## From memory, write a code snippet for 

## What does it mean for coding to be "idiomatic"? Give one example of idiomatic vs non-idiomatic coding in JavaScript.

## There is overhead to sending a request to another machine over the network. Make a (simple) quantitative argument re why it's still often faster to fetch data from Redis vs not using it.
Hint: Figure out specific speed numbers for the alternative(s). Give some average speeds + maybe some arithmetic comparing one flow to another.
