# Reactor Prep Diagnostic

Welcome to the Reactor Prep diagnostic module!

We also call this "Module 0", the first of 4 modules in the prep course.

## The Goal

Your goal is to demonstrate (to yourself, mostly) that you have learned enough fundamentals of JavaScript and programming to be able to efficiently dive into the main course material.


## Setup

### Repl.it

In order to join our classroom located on Repl.it, start by clicking [this link](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/ulPK04).

Once the page loads, create your Repl.it Classroom account. Again, please use your **real, full name** when signing up.

## What to do

Now that you've joined the classroom, the problems in the left sidebar will be activated and ready to work on.

In order to pass the diagnostic, you will need to complete ALL of the problems by getting all of the tests to pass.

To begin a problem, simply click on its name in the side bar.

The screen will be split into two separate sections, divided down the middle.

On the right hand side will be a description of the problem, please read this carefully.

The left hand side will be split, top and bottom, with some starter code on the top left, and a console on the bottom left.

The console will have the words `Native Browser Javascript` written at the top. This is where any `console.log` messages will appear when you click `Run`, located in the middle of the top left section of the screen. There is a drop down icon on this `Run` button, which will allow you to run the tests; seeing if your code works.

Within the `starter code`, written on the upper left hand section of the display, there will be a function, within which you will find the comment “// your code here”. This is where you will be implementing a solution to the problem described in the instructions.

Once you feel you have completed the exercise, you can click the green “Submit” button, located on the upper right hand corner of the page.

Another smaller display will pop up telling you whether or not you have passed all of the tests. It will either list that you have some failed tests, listed in red, or that all tests have passed.



If all tests pass, simply click `Submit` and move on to the next problem.

If there are any failed tests, they will appear red, meaning you have not solved the problem. DO NOT CLICK `Submit Anyway` as this will mean that you have given up.

Rather than this, you can click on each test, or click `What’s Wrong`, in order to see what is going on within the test, and why your answer has failed.

At this point, you should click `Keep Trying`, which will return you to the problem, where you can adjust your answer until all the tests pass.

You will know you have completed the problem once you receive the green `You've completed this assignment` message at the top of the repl.it module.

When you finish the three exercises and have clicked "Complete and continue", you are finished with the diagnostic and ready to move on to Module 1. **Note: It is extremely important to remember to click "Complete and continue" as you finish the exercises.**

## FAQ

### Is this an "open book" test?

Yes, you can look up JavaScript syntax. For this purpose, we strongly recommend staying on the Mozilla Developer Network site, which has very reliable information, and not wandering randomly around the entire Internet.

### What should I do if I get stuck?

* If you are not sure about how to use a particular JavaScript method, try googling it on MDN:
    * e.g., searching on "MDN sort" will give you the MDN pages about JavaScript's `sort()` method.
* If something is not behaving the way you expect, use `console.log` to experiment and see what exactly is happening.
* If you still cannot figure it out, try starting from scratch. Implement an alternate solution entirely.

### What happens if I can't get all the tests to pass?

If you aren't quite ready, don't worry. Just go back to [Codecademy's JavaScript track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)  to review the basics and try the diagnostic again a little later.
