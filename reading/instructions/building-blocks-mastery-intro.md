# Reactor Prep Module 1: Building Blocks Review

Welcome to Module 1!

This module's focus is "reviewing the building blocks".  It's the 2nd of 4 modules in the Reactor Prep program.


### If it's the _2nd_ module, why call it "module _1_"?

Since computers use binary math, in programming, you typically begin counting from 0, not from 1.  We are getting you used to programmer-speak.


## The Goal

This module consists of **lots** of **very small** problems.

Your goal is to complete all of them, and warm up before proceeding on to bigger, harder problems.

Abe Lincoln said: "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." Well, get ready to sharpen your axe.

You will read more on our philosophy in the next lesson, _Know theEasyStuffCold_.


## What to do

In order to gain access to the problems, start by clicking [this link](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/uLbweq).

Once you have access, close the new window or tab and navigate through the problems using the left side bar. You can do problems in any order, but like last time, **please remember to click the _Complete and continue_ button** on the top right of your screen once you get each problem's tests to pass.

Many of these questions will be simple, and others will involve a few steps. Throughout this process, you will refine your googling skills, get used to typing out javascript syntax, and analyzing failed tests, all of which are vital to your success as a software engineer.

Please finish all of the assignments. Yes, there's a lot of them, but keep tackling them and you'll be fine.


## Things to keep in mind

* You will need to complete 100% of these Module 1 assignments. 
* You will not be receiving direct feedback on the code that you submit in this Module. Progress is driven entirely by the automated tests.
* Problems do not need to completed in any order.
* If you get stuck on one...
    * try to solve some others before returning to where you got lost.
    * Do **not** click `Submit Anyway`. See the FAQ below on what to do.
* It is unlikely you will complete all of these exercises in one sitting. Give your mind time to absorb what you have accomplished and you will be amazed at how rapidly your skills and general approach to programming improve.
* If you are pretty sure that a test or a problem is broken, please feel free to let us know in Slack, via the `#mod1_building_blocks` channel. 


## FAQ

### But that's so many problems!

Our philosophy is for you to know how to do the basic stuff fluidly and almost automatically. We haven't found a better way for you to get better at that than, well, to practice!

You'll be able to do this. Stick with it.


### But I'm too advanced for this stuff!

If you are truly solid on this material, you should fly through it, right? :) Bear with us. The idea isn't being able to do the problems at all, it's doing them _quickly_ and _fluently_. That way you have an easier time with the harder problems.

### Is this "open book"?

Yes, you can look up JavaScript syntax. For this purpose, we strongly recommend staying on the Mozilla Developer Network site, which has very reliable information, and not wandering randomly around the entire Internet.

### What should I do if I get stuck on a problem?

* If you are not sure about how to use a particular JavaScript method, try googling it on MDN:
    * e.g., searching on "MDN sort" will give you the MDN pages about JavaScript's `sort()` method.
* If something is not behaving the way you expect, use `console.log` to experiment and see what exactly is happening.
* If you still cannot figure it out, try starting from scratch. Implement an alternate solution.

### What happens if I can't get all the tests to pass for a problem?

See above, on getting unstuck.

Above all, please do **not** press `Submit Anyway` in Repl.it. If you truly can't figure out a problem, perhaps there's an issue with the problem itself (we may have mis-calibrated its difficulty or there may be some other problem that has nothing to do with you). Please reach out to us via the `#mod1_building_blocks` channel on Slack. `**Paid Users:** You may also reach out to us on your private, dedicated support channel.`

### What happens if I'm really struggling on multiple problems?

Your best bet will be getting help from the community. Reach out on Slack, via the `#mod1_building_blocks` channel, and let's examine your situation. `**Paid Users:** You may also reach out to us on your private, dedicated support channel.`
