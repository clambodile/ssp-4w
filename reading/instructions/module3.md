# Reactor Prep Module 3: Live Performance

Welcome to Module 3!

This module's focus is taking all the good problem-solving and clean-code-writing skills you practiced in the previous module, and practicing those same skills in a live performance context.

## Overview

### Live-coding with an audience is its own set of skills

Admissions interviews are, in effect, **live performances**.  So are the real job interviews that you will encounter later.

In general, code pairing -- i.e., where you code in real-time with a coding partner -- is also a species of "live performance".

Effective live-coding with another person is a very useful skill to have throughout your career. Let's start honing that skill now! 

This is similar to any kind of solo rehearsal or practice -- stand-up comedians practice their material in front of a mirror, tennis players rally against a practice wall, parliamentary debaters practice preparing and delivering their statements while timing themselves.


## The Goal

You will practice and demonstrate your ability to understand, plan, and cleanly implement a coding problem under the twin pressures of limited time and a live, collaborative audience.

## What to do

### 1) Read the concepts and techniques of live coding performance

Read these short articles found in this module:

* Mental model of what the interviewer wants
* Rapport with your interviewer
* Avoiding assumptions
* Make a plan first
* Getting unstuck
* Type faster!
* How to run your interview


### 2) A key practice tool: videos!

The motivating theme behind the Live Performance module is that you can get a lot of benefit from **recording videos** and **assessing your own performance** first, i.e., before you even ask anyone else to watch you perform.

You know how your voice sounds "funny" to you when you hear a recording of it?  Well, watching and listening to a screencast of yourself attempting to solve a coding problem can be **pretty eye-opening**!  You will see all kinds of obvious ways to improve the way you're solving the problem and the way you're coming across to the audience as you do so.


### 3) PAID FEATURE: Live mock interview(s)

Talk to the staff on your private channel to find live mock interview slots.

Pay careful attention to the _How to run your interview_ article in this section and start solving problems live.

## FAQ

### How do I record a screencast with audio?

On a Mac, we suggest using the built-in Quicktime Player. Make sure to TURN ON AUDIO, like this:
